Steps to get the app running.
1) In your Google Drive account, create a new folder preferably in the home location to reduce complexities of permissions
and file paths. e.g call the folder test
2) Double click the folder to open it.
3) Take note of the url, the string that comes after folders is the folder ID.
e.g if the url is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/123abscdefghIHG, the folder ID is 123abscdefghIHG
4) Now, you'll need to share the folder with thr service account email to enable the api to be able to upload files into it.
5) How do you get a service account?
    a) Visit the Google Cloud Console using this link: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com
    b) Enable the Google Drive api
    c) You do not need to add a CREDIT card for this to work at this point, however after subsequent tests Google
     might ask you to add a payment method to activate your GCP credit of $400.
    d) Proceed to create a service account
    e) After creating the service account create a new key and download the json file.
        This is the file you will need in line 9.
6) Copy the service account email and go back to the folder you created on google drive and share to that email
as though you were sharing the folder with any other gmail user.
7) You can proceed to run your script and you should see the test.txt file uploaded on your Drive
